**1. Project Overview** (~1 paragraph)

* We created a tool which allows a user to find the nearest MTA publicit stop based on any address or place. Through the use of the weather API as well as the Mapbox API, we were able to transform the address and to a precise longitude and latitude which allowed us to find the nearest transit stop as well as including details about the wheelchair accessibility. We attempted to use the events API from Eventbrite but for some reason it never was able to retrieve the events even though we gave it the correct API and checked.

**2. Reflection** (~3 paragraphs + screenshots)

* We found that the project itself was very interesting in terms of utilizing flask more in general. We found some errors when we ran the MBTA API but we figured out how to deal with them by testing the outputs through printing them out. Though this assignment had a relatively short timeline, we were able to set milestones for when things should be done and found that visualizing the code with pprint helped us with most of the troubleshooting.
* One notable area of improvement would be the implementation of the event API since we were unable to retrieve the data.
